# TriviaGame.github.io

This is a classic trivia game. You'll score points based on the amount left on the timer. There are 20 science based questions. Click on your choice A-D. 

This isn't my most attractive app, but it does work. Quite a bit of the javascript was challenging, but the HTML and CSS were mostly pretty basic. The only real new thing there was using :hover for the first time to clarify to the player which answer they are choosing.

This was our first time using timers for an assignment. This was straightforward enough. The most frustrating, and in the end most easily solved, problem was questions kept getting skipped. Using unbind() on the click handlers solved that quite nicely.

On my todo list for this app is to change the appearance (duh) and having the question box not click over to an 'undefined' question #21 at the end. Given time, I would also add a lot more questions and probably store the questions/answers in a different way.
